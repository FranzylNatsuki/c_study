Next-Greater-Element (to the right) — stack practice (easy–medium)
Short goal (one sentence): for each number in a list, find the first number to its right that is larger (or say “none” if there isn’t one).
No code — only plain-word steps and a fully described example.

Algorithm described in words (step-by-step)
Start with an empty stack and an empty list of answers (one answer per input number, initially “unknown”).

Move through the numbers from left to right, looking at one number at a time (call it the current number).

For each current number, compare it to the number on the top of the stack (if the stack is not empty):

If the current number is bigger than the stack’s top, then the stack’s top has found its next-greater: the current number. Record that pairing (stack-top → current number) and remove that stack-top. Keep doing this comparison-and-remove while the stack is non-empty and the current number remains bigger than the new top.

If the current number is not bigger than the stack’s top (or the stack is empty), you cannot assign a next-greater for the top right now. So simply place the current number on top of the stack and move on to the next input number.

Continue until you’ve processed every number in the input.

When you finish scanning, any numbers still left in the stack do not have a next-greater to their right — mark their answers as “none” (or -1).
